> Can we include RX in the nofib suite? 

yes sure. after `make' in src/, there's `make check' in examples/
that keeps the system busy for a while.

i used RX to check parts of a proof of a main result
of my PhD thesis. (that's exactly what `make check' does).
and i used lots of other haskell programs to generate
examples and conjectures - so ghc/hbc/hugs were (are) 
crucial tools for my research.

the RX code is not optimized too much, i'm afraid.
however i hope that ghc is able to specialize away
most of the overloaded functions. can this be done automatically?
i'm too lazy to insert all those pragmas.

by the way, executables compiled with ghc -O2 
give me bus errors on sparc-sunos5 (ghc-2.10 is all i have. -O works.)
