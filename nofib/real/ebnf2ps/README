What is Ebnf2ps?

A context free grammar in EBNF is translated into syntax diagrams
(also known as railroad diagrams). Output is in encapsulated
Postscript, ready to use with LaTeX, or in Fig.
The syntax of the input file is specified in ebnf.BNF.
There is a sample file called gofer.BNF (guess what it is...).
Ebnf2ps -help gives some first aid.

[gofer's BNF is originally taken from Mark Jones's gofer distribution]

Instructions to build Ebnf2ps, the ultimate EBNF illustrator.

1. edit the Makefile to reflect your Haskell compiler, for example
	HC= hbc
2. find out where your TeX installation stores .afm-files (Adobe font
   metric files) and change the variable "afmPathDefault" in
   Ebnf2ps.hs accordingly. Alternatively, you can set the environment
   variable AFMPATH when running the program.
   These files are absolutely necessary. If you can't find them, get
   them from ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/AFMFiles/
3. change the variable "rgbPathDefault" to contain the directory where
   your X installation stores its color data base (usually
   /usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt). This can also be corrected later with the
   environment variable "RGBPATH".
   There are fallback color definitions for the 8 digital colors
   (black, white, blue, green, cyan, reg, magenta, yellow, white), so 
   nothing needs be done if that's enough for you.
4. make
