      * 0.3 released
      * many bugfixes (an important one relates to 3 way and
	higher order reactions which we computed incorrectly
	in version 0.2).
      * another significant overhaul of SGL language specs which
	are now much more streamlined. Main changes

	- dropped "def" keyword from input block to simplify parser
	- all SGL identifier that expect a Double/Integer literal
	  now accept either parse-time or run-time statement blocks.
	- the event definition block syntax is now much more
	  consistent with the rest of the SGL
	- the "outputFile" keyword has been moved to the output
	  block
	  
       * simgi will now try to evaluate statement blocks while
	 parsing in order to minimize the run-time overhead.
       * added many more tests to the test suite.

      * 0.2 released.
      * significant overhaul of SGL language spec. This will break
        backward compatibility with simgi 0.1.
      * replaced simple RNG with a 64 bit Mersenne Twister implementation.
      * added expression statements and the ability to describe
        simulation events via the "events" block.
      * added ability to specify output format.

	changes needed for uploading to Hackage).
