Version: 1.0 (January, 2002)



The example directory contain the following files:

  - real         

    the regular expression defining a notation for real numbers 

  - real_dfa.hs

    the result of:  ../bin/halex -D -M < real > real_dfa.hs
 
  - real_ndfa.hs

    the result of:  ../bin/halex -N < real > real_ndfa.hs

  - real_dfa.ps

    the result of:  ../bin/halex -G -M < real | dot -Tps > real_dfa.ps

  - real_ndfa.ps

    the result of:  ../bin/halex -G -N < real | dot -Tps -Gsize=30,30 > real_ndfa.ps

  - GenMDfa.hs 

    the result of:  ../bin/halex -M -E < real

    (to produce an "animator" for the real regular expression, just
     call the following makefile

                make -f ../scripts/Make_Animation 

     the program animation if produced. It accepts as input a sentence
     (a real number) and produces the animation).
