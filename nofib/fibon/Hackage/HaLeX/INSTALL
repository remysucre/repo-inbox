Version: 1.1 (January, 2005)


- halex batch tool

To install the halex batch tool just call the provided makefile. The
halex tool is installed in the sub-directory bin.

The makefile uses the ghc compiler, but this tool can be compiled (or
interpreted) using any Haskell compiler (or using hmake).

- the animations

To run the animations, the library includes a main module
(MainAnim.hs) that imports the generated Haskell-based automata
produced by halex. This module runs the (lefty) script that animates
the acceptance function. 

To install this module it is needed to update the path to the lefty
script (lefty_tool) in  file animation.hs.
