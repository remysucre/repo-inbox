This directory contains the test suite for CPSA.  Files with a .scm
extension are expected to succeed, ones with a .lsp extension expected
are expected to fail, and ones with a .lisp are not run.  The .lisp
files may run for a long time and succeed or maybe they fail.  The
test suite is usually run by typing "sh cpsatst.sh" in the parent
directory.

After running the test suite, you will note files with the extension
.xml.  These are XHTML/SVG compound documents that can be viewed by
standards compliant browsers such as Firefox and Safari.

New users should study CPSA's analysis of the following protocols in
order, Needham-Schroeder (ns.xml), Woo-Lam (woolan.xml), Yahalom
(yahalom.xml), ffgg (ffgg.xml), and finally Otway-Rees (or.xml).  When
studying the full output, simultaneously display the extracted shapes.
The shapes file has an extension of _shapes.xml.

On the first pass, just look at the first two problems in the analysis
of the Needham-Schroeder Protocol, and return to this test case when
reading about role origination assumptions in the primer.
