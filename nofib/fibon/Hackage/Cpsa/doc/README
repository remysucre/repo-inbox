This directory contains CPSA documentation.

* cpsauser.html: The CPSA User Guide, a key reference document

* cpsaprimer.pdf: The CPSA Primer, an introduction to using CPSA

* cpsaoverview.pdf: Another attempt at a gentle introduction to CPSA

The remaining documents must be built.

* cpsaspec.pdf: The CPSA Specification, a formal specification of the algorithm

* cpsadesign.pdf: The CPSA Design, a description of implementation choices.

To build the documentation, the file supp-pdf.tex must be installed.
It is part of the TexLive texmf ConTeXt package.  On Linux, the name
of the package is context or texlive-context.  The design document and
the specification document require the xy-pic package, which is
included in texlive-pictures.

If you want to build the documentation from the sources, and you don't
have and want to install the cmarrows package for Metapost, comment
out the line in cpsadiagrams.mp that loads cmstrands.
