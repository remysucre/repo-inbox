# This script runs the test suite, and then reduces the data for
# inspection.  If make fails, something is very wrong.  If differences
# appear in the output, there might be a problem.

# These scripts in the tst directory might also serve as a template
# for your needs, but probably not.  Look at doc/cpsa.mk first.
