	* cpsa.cabal (Version): Tagged as version 2.1.0.

2010-07-23  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* cpsa.cabal (Cabal-Version): CPSA now assumes Cabal is version
	1.6 or greater, and support for GHC 6.8 has been withdrawn.

	* src/CPSA/Graph/Loader.hs (loadDefs): The graph program displays
	the initial comments in an input file.

2010-07-14  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Main.hs (options): Four new command line options
	have been added:

	  -c         --check-nonces     check nonces first
	  -t         --try-old-strands  try old strands first
	  -r         --reverse-nodes    try old nodes first

2010-07-09  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Strand.hs (contractAndOrder): Support for this
	addition to authentication test solving has been removed.

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Cohort.hs (contractions): Contraction has changed
	so that it only solves the test for one position of the critical
	message in the test node, not every position.  Previously, CPSA
	was missing most general solutions due to contracting too many
	positions at the same time.

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Strand.hs (pruneStrands): The pruning condition now
	checks to see that there is a variable renaming between the
	preskeletons involved.  Previously, the only check ensured the map
	was idempotent.

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Cohort.hs (useEcapeSetInTargetTerms): Added an
	option to include the escape set in the set of target terms.

	uniquely originating atom that is gained must be after the node of
	origination.  It used to be that only nodes in which the atom is
	acquired must have the ordering.

	finding pairs of strands to hull.

2010-06-07  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Cohort.hs (cowt): As does cows, the cowt has to
	iterate to ensure all places are considered.  This change fixes
	the bug exposed by the tst/non_transforming.scm text case.

2010-06-03  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Cohort.hs (transformingNode): Removed junk in
	output by applying the mgu filter to more substitutions used to
	construct augmentations.  This fix has a dramatic effect on
	performance for the NSL4 and NSL5 test cases.

2010-05-06  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Cohort.hs (useMguFilter): Turned off all mgu
	filtering for contractions and augmentations.

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Algebra.hs: Changed signature for unification and
	matching so as to pass through a variable generator for
	Diffie-Hellman.  Threaded the variable generator throughout the
	library as needed.

	* src/CPSA/Diffie-Hellman/Algebra.hs:  Added a module for
	analyzing protocols that use Diffie-Hellman.  Its unifier and

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Cohort.hs (mgus): Added a filter that removes
	non-most general unifiers from a list of contractions after the
	list has been filtered to ensure each member solves the test.  For

	removes non-most general unifiers from the list of augmentations
	after the list has been filtered to ensure each member solves the
	test.

2009-08-28  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Cohort.hs (testDestroyingContractions): Added a
	filter that removes non-most general unifiers from the generated

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Displayer.hs (displayOpTerm, displayOpTerms): Terms
	in the operation field may contain variables not in the skeleton.
	Two functions were added for printing terms is the operation
	field.  These functions extend the display context as needed.

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Strand.hs (permutations): Reversed the order in
	which strands are matched, and found a big performance
	improvement. 

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Loader.hs (loadRole): Unused variables in a role

	to use CPSA for protocol design and made other improvements.

2009-07-07  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Cohort.hs (maybeAug): Use a role's trace as a
	template instead of generating a fresh instance for that purpose.

2009-07-01  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/Graph/LaTeXView.hs (latexView): 

2009-06-23  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Search.hs (solve): The top-level search loop is now
	implemented in the IO monad using tail recursive functions so as to
	ensure data is released when it should.

2009-06-21  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Search.hs (solve): Added no isomorphism checking
	mode (--noisochk).  In noisochk mode, isomorphism checks are

	generalizing realized skeletons.

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Search.hs (Params): Collected runtime parameters
	into a record.

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Search.hs (dump): Dump no longer generalizes
	realized skeletons.  It just dumps them quickly.

	the collapsing operation, and fix other minor problems.

2009-06-14  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* doc/cpsadesign.tex: This document was rewritten.  It now assumes
	its reader have already read the CPSA specification
	(doc/cpsaspec.tex).  As a result, it focuses on implementation
	issues, and leaves correctness issues to the specification.

2009-06-11  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Strand.hs (instRnon,instRunique): Filter
	origination assumptions using the terms in the instance's trace.

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Strand.hs (separateVariable): Don't memoize subsets
	computation.  It causes memory problems when a large permutation
	is used infrequently.

	moved into the Entry module and shared.

2009-05-27  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/Lib/{Search.hs,Expand.hs}: CPSA now expands macros
	rather than using a preprocessor for the task.  The cpsapp program
	now just pretty prints its input.

	* src/CPSA/Pretty/Main.hs: The source for the cpsapp program has
	moved into another directory as it no longer macro expands its
	input.

	* doc/cpsa.mk: Makefile no longer has preprocessor support.

	* doc/cpsaoverview.tex: Add a short overview of CPSA.

	* src/CPSA/Annotations/Formulas.hs (keywords): "t" and "f" are no
	longer keywords in formulas.  Use (and) for truth and (or) for
	falsehood.

2009-05-22  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/Macros/Main.hs (prettyPrint): Add -p option so that
	cpsapp pretty prints without macro expansion.

2009-05-12  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* cpsa.cabal (Version): Tagged as version 1.4.4.

	* cpsa.cabal (Flag par): Changed the default for the par flag to
	true so that CPSA is compiled with multiprocessor support by
	default.

2009-05-11  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/Lib/SExpr.hs (Tokens): Added strictness annotations
	that allows the reading of much larger input files and improves
	performance.

2009-05-10  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Strand.hs (collapse): Added the collapse operation
	which applies to a shape.  It attempts to unify pairs of strands
	and searches for shapes starting from the results.
	
	* src/CPSA/Shapes/Shapes.hs (shapes): Reduced memory requirements
	by use of shape notes and added support for output in which a
	shape is a descendent of a shape.

2009-05-09  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Search.hs (commentPreskel): Added a shape note to
	be used by the cpsashapes program.

2009-05-07  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Strand.hs (hull, enrich, prune): With the
	correction of the pruning algorithm, the preskeleton reduction
	rules are now applied in the order of hull, enrich, and then
	prune.

2009-05-05  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* doc/cpsaspec.tex: Added the sources to the CPSA document that
	specifies CPSA as a reduction system.

2009-05-04  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Strand.hs (pruneStrands): The pruning operation
	now uses a substitution that is idempotent for strands other than
	the pruned strand.

2009-04-29  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* cpsa.cabal (Version): Tagged as version 1.4.3.

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Cohort.hs (specialization): The homomorphism check
	is applied to the preskeleton because it matches the strand
	mapping.  This fixes a bug that reject some valid generalizations.

2009-04-19  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Algebra.hs (Subst): A substitution is now required
	to be ordered.

	* src/CPSA/Basic/Algebra.hs (unifyChase): The exported version of
	a substitution no longer requires chasing to find the canonical
	representative of the equivalence class of variables determined to
	be equal.  This means there is a canonical representation of an
	external version of a substitution that is ordered.

	* src/CPSA/Basic/Algebra.hs (substitute): Corrected a bug in
	substitution associated with variables of sort mesg.  The
	correction effects tst/dy.scm only.

2009-04-18  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/Basic/Algebra.hs (IdMap): Use Data.Map Id Term for
	substitutions instead of association lists. 

	* src/CPSA/Basic/Algebra.hs (loadVar): Removed sort "term" as a
	synonym for "mesg".

2009-04-14  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/Basic/Algebra.hs (compose):  Corrected a bug in the
	code that removes the trivial bindings from s2 to form s4.  The
	fix changes the output for tst/dy.scm.

2009-03-30  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* cpsa.cabal (Version): Tagged as version 1.4.2.

2009-03-27  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Search.hs (parMap): Added support for SMP
	parallelism.  To enable, configure with -fpar.

2009-03-22  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Printer.hs: Added a CPSA specific pretty printer
	and made it so that the roles in protocols are laid out using the
	group layout.

2009-03-03  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Pretty.hs (grp): Added support for the group layout
	and used it for the top-level lists.

2009-03-01  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Cohort.hs (unifyTerm): For contraction, the
	unifyOnPaths function does not check to see if its result has the
	desired properties and it turns out that sometimes it doesn't.
	Now unifyTerm repeats its operations until the desired properties
	hold.

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Cohort.hs (unifyPast): For augmentation, the
	original unifyPast failed to each to see if the final result has
	the desired properties, and it turns out that sometimes it
	doesn't.  Now unifyPast repeats its operations until the desired
	properties hold.

2009-02-23  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Loader.hs (loadInsts): Check for preskeletons
	with no strands.

2009-02-21  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* cpsa.cabal (Version): Tagged as version 1.4.1.

	* doc/*: Update document to reflect changes.

2009-02-10  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/Macros/*.hs: Added the macro preprocessor cpsapp.

2009-02-08  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/Annotations/Annotations.hs (loadFormulas): Allow base
	terms as principals so as to allow keys as principals.

2009-01-03  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Strand.hs (changeLocations): Changed variable
	separation so that so that two candidates are generated for a
	location configuration, one that maps the changes to uniques, and
	the other does not.  This fixes a generalization bug.

2009-01-31  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	option to allow the selection of depth first search.

	* src/CPSA/Graph/SVG.hs (kbutton): Duplicate nodes are now
	rendered in italic so as to make it easier to distinguish them
	from tree nodes.

	* src/CPSA/*/{Main.hs,Search.hs}: Added default option values to
	command line help message.

2008-12-03  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

2008-11-30  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>
	
	* src/CPSA/Lib/Strand.hs (roleOrigCheck): Added new well-formed
	preskeleton check.  Every uniquely originating role term mapped by
	an instance must be mapped to a term that originates on the
	instance's strand.

2008-11-19  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Search.hs (nextState): Switched to

	variables in isomorphism check to speed it up.

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Algebra.hs: (matchVarRenaming) The special purpose
	renaming detector was eliminated in favor of using matching and
	predicate that decides if a match is one-to-one and
	variable-to-variable.

2008-11-16  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Strand.hs (deleteNode): Use the transitive closure

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Cohort.hs (addListeners):  Listeners are now added
	only for the decryption keys of the top most encryptions in the
	escape set.  This fixes a bug caused by adding listeners for 
	decryption keys of internal encryptions in the escape set.

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Algebra.hs (decryptionKey):  Changed the name from
	keysUsedBy to reflect the fact only the decryption key from the
	top most encryption is returned.

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Algebra.hs (protectors): Changed the name from
	decrypts to better reflect the purpose of the function.

2008-11-10  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/Annotations/Annotations.hs (obligations): The alist key
	theorems was replaced with obligations as it lists the formulas
	one is obligated to show are theorems to show the protocol is
	sound.

	of the design document.

2008-10-27  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Strand.hs (deleteNode): When deleting a strand,
	this function used to apply the inverse of the correct permutation
	to the prob field, but now applies the correct permutation.

2008-10-19  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/Graph/Main.hs (options): Add --compact option to select
	the use of the compact output format.

2008-10-15  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Cohort.hs (targetTerms): Added term extraction from
	the escape set for use as targets for binding with the carried
	terms in an outbound when looking for a transforming node.  This
	change allows CPSA to find the flaw in the Dolev-Yao Example 1.3
	test case.

2008-10-14  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Cohort.hs (augmentations): Changed the augmentation

	terms, a concatenation is added to all but the last term.

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Strand.hs (tryPerm): An isomorphism testing bug was
	fixed.  The permutation map was applied to the wrong ordering.

2008-10-03  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* cpsa.cabal (Version): Tagged as version 1.2.3.

	* src/CPSA/Graph/ExpandedView.hs (header): The title generated for
	the expanded view now includes the name of the first protocol to
	be graphed.

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Search.hs (search): The comment generated for
	non-default strand bounded or step count limited runs contained
	an illegal character that has been removed.

	* src/CPSA/Basic/Algebra.hs (displaySubst): This function displays
	substitutions without requiring that the sort of every variable be
	known.  The function that infers enough sort information to
	perform the display was correct, thus fixing a reported bug.

2008-09-30  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Algebra.hs (Context): Changed the interface to
	contexts to allow them to be extended.  Also, eliminated

	other functions in the interface.

2008-09-26  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Cohort.hs (transformingNode): The fix on the 22th
	wasn't right, it unified on all outgoing terms.  The function now
	unifies an outgoing term only when it is a transforming node.
	
2008-09-24  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/*/*.hs:  Loading works with all monads.  With this
	change, there is no longer a need for using the flexible instances
	language extension.

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Search.hs (par): Added HAVE_PAR preprocessor symbol
	which should be defined when Control.Parallel is available.

	* src/CPSA/*/*.hs:  A major code clean up was completed.
	
2008-09-17  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Strand.hs (Gist): Created a data structure designed

	* cpsa.cabal (Version): Tagged as version 1.2.1.

2008-08-23  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Strand.hs (weakenOrderings): Changed the weakening
	algorithm so as to use the transitive closure.  The result is all
	possible weakenings are considered, and a reported bug was fixed.

2008-08-19  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/Graph/ExpandedView.hs (kdrawer): Added the definition
	of the marker for arrow heads so that arrow heads now appear in
	preskeleton drawings.

2008-08-18  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* cpsa.cabal (Version): Tagged as version 1.2.0.

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Utilities.hs (permutations): Used permutations from
	Haskell 1.3 as a model, and ensured the identity permutation is
	the first one in the result.

	* doc/cpsatutorial.tex, doc/cpsauser.html: Changed the
	introductions to note that the search for shapes in the current
	implementation is known to be not complete.  See tst/dy.scm.

2008-08-11  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* tst/Makefile: Changed the file extensions to be consistent with

	* cpsa.cabal: Added support for local installation.

	* doc/cpsa.mk: Added GNU Make rules for inclusion.

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Search.hs: Reorganized search loop so that
	S-expression printing is done outside the search code.

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Search.hs: Modified the abort dump routine so that
	it minimizes when it is asked to print a realized skeleton.

2008-07-31  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/*/Loader.hs: Ignore top-level S-expression of the form
	(comment S-EXP*) rather than signal an error so as to allow file
	level comments as S-expressions.

	* src/CPSA/*/*: Renamed cpsabasic to cpsa, as that program can now
	provide support for more than one algebra.

2008-07-28  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Algebra.hs: Added foldTerms to interface. It folds
	a function through a term applying it to each term that occurs in
	the term.

2008-07-26  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Algebra.hs: Added carriedPlaces and ancestors to

	foldOnAllPathsToTarget to CPSA.Lib.Cohort as they no longer need
	to be implemented by each algebra.

2008-07-25  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/*/*.hs: Reorganized the algebra interface so that as
	algebra exports an algebra specific protocol loader so as to allow
	CPSA to handle more than one algebra at a time.  Algebras are now
	linked into the program in CPSA.Lib.Main.

2008-07-24  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* src/CPSA/Lib/Search.hs: Added the --bound option to limit the
	number of strands in a skeleton.
